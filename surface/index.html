Surface is a project that explores issues arising in our ocean as well as visually relating it to a constructed narrative.
<br><br>
Our ocean is polluted with countless tiny pieces of plastic. They sit on the surface of the ocean, blocking vital sunlight from reaching the depths, creating dead areas. These plastics are carried through the ocean's surface currents. <br><br>

In an effort to visualize what it would be like if plastic polluted the sky, a dozen photographs were taken during various times in the day using a 35mm film camera. These photographs were developed in a darkroom with pieces of plastic on their surface. Finally, these photographs were inkjet printed on Japanese digital paper and turned into a book.
                   <br><br>

Using a live map of the ocean, currents from Japan, to the North Pacific Gyre, to California were mapped and transformed into line drawings. These drawings were printed on extremely thin Japanese paper. The line drawings are folded around the photographs, allowing the viewer to see the currents against the sky. Data on the current was printed on the front, while the location and time of the photograph was printed on the back.
                   <br><br>

The cover and chapter dividers of the collective book, "20 words 20 works" was created using maps of forest cover, which were generated into a series of points.
